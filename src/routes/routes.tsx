/*
  Routes Component
  This component defines the main routing structure of the application using React Router.

  The component includes:
  - Usage of the `useAuth` hook to access user authentication status.
  - Conditional rendering of `PrivateRoutes` when the user is logged in and `PublicRoutes` when not logged in.
  - Wrapping the routing structure with `BrowserRouter` to enable routing functionality.

  Example Usage:
  Include the `Routes` component in your main application entry point to establish the application's routing structure based on user authentication status.
